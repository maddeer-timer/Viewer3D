## Introduction
* This is a software for reading and displaying 3D models, and it can also be used for format conversion. 
* It loads and displays the model by using PyQt and PyOpenGL. 
* You can use the keyboard to move the model, or use the mouse to rotate and scale the model.

## Requirements
* The source code of this software uses two libraries: PyQt5, PyOpenGL.
* You can use pip to install PyQT by using "pip install pyqt5".
* However, to install PyOpenGL on a 64-bit machine, you need to visit  [this website][1], because pip will install the 32-bit version by default.
* In addition to this, another option is to use a packaged application, you can download it [here][2].
