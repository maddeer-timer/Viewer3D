# Introduction
This is a software for reading and displaying 3D models, and it can also be used for format conversion. 
It loads and displays the model by using PyQt and PyOpenGL. 
You can use the keyboard to move the model, or use the mouse to rotate and scale the model.

# Requirements
The source code of this software uses two libraries: PyQt5, PyOpenGL.
You can use pip to install PyQT by using "pip install pyqt5".
However, to install PyOpenGL on a 64-bit machine, you need to visit  [this website](https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#pyopengl),  because pip will install the 32-bit version by default.
In addition to this, another option is to use a packaged application, you can download it [here](https://www.github.com).
